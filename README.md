### Authorization
###### I'm using simpleJWT, so you can read about it
Using CLI run

POST a new Poll with it's name: `POST /polls` <br><br>
POST all your questions using `POST /questions`, don't forget to send your new poll's id <br>
if it's first question in your poll, than you sould leave `prev=None`, if it's last question, leave `next=None` <br><br>
POST all your answers using `POST /answers` <br>

### Get active polls 
`/polls?active=true` - get all polls that are currently available

### Get User stats
